## Brief Description
This is a 5-day Workshop, conduted by [VLSI System Design](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/), which focuses on FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays). The Workshops consists of 5 modules. The first module focuses on taking a digital design through Xilinx Vivado and programming it on the FPGA. We also demonstrate area, timing analysis and post implementation simulation. In the second module we describe the OpenFPGA framework and demonstrate the VTR tool flow on two designs with an example architecture. Next, we repeat these tasks for a RISC-V based processor called RVMyth. We simulate RVMyth with a testbench through Vivado and program it on a Basys3 board. We then take it through the OpenFPGA framework through Skywater OpenSource FPGA (SOFA). We also demonstrate area, timing analysis and post implementation simulation for the processor core after taking it through SOFA. Lastly, we summarize the area and timing results obtained by the design from Basys3 and VTR.
