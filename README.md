## Brief Description
This is a 5-day Workshop, conduted by [VLSI System Design](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/), which focuses on FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays). The Workshops consists of 5 modules. The first module focuses on taking a digital design through Xilinx Vivado and programming it on the FPGA. We also demonstrate area, timing analysis and post implementation simulation. In the second module we describe the OpenFPGA framework and demonstrate the VTR tool flow on two designs with an example architecture. Next, we repeat these tasks for a RISC-V based processor called RVMyth. We simulate RVMyth with a testbench through Vivado and program it on a Basys3 board. We then take it through the OpenFPGA framework through Skywater OpenSource FPGA (SOFA). We also demonstrate area, timing analysis and post implementation simulation for the processor core after taking it through SOFA. Lastly, we summarize the area and timing results obtained by the design from Basys3 and VTR.

# Conclusion

The 5-Day Workshop on FPGA - Fabric, Design and Architecture introduces its participants to the _________ , which is particularly important for students and professionals, who intend to pursue a career in _______ . The Workshop had a good balance between the theory and practicals. The lectures were short and informative and the labs were sufficiently challenging. The inclusion of assessments at the end was also a good for revision. The overall rigour and depth of the Workshop is highly appreciable.
